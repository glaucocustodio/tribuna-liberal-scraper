This is a Ruby script to download the latest issue from their [official website](https://www.tribunaliberal.com.br/).

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/glaucocustodio/tribuna-liberal-scraper/blob/master/.github/workflows/downloader.yml) is set up to run this script daily and commit its outcome, hence, keeping a history of issues on the git repo.
